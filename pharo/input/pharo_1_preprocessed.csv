i allow elements to optimize working with children for different scenarious. for example, an array for storing children optimises for accessing fast accesses at any position. a linked list optimize for fast adding and removing. a rope uses a balanced binary tree to support fast adding, removing and accessing, with the disadvantage of taking more memory.

i do not enforce a lazy api. subclasses can perform the filtering immediately or when iteration over children is required. i aim to maintain the composition of subsets while optimizing for speed whenever possible.

api
instances of me are created by calling the factory method method blchildrensubset class #on on a subclass with an instance of class blchildren as parameter.

subclasses need to override the method method blchildrensubset #subsetfrom to filter the elements from the given class blchildren instance. this can perform no filtering, filter elements, or also change the order of elements.

implementation details
internally the result of method blchildrensubset #subsetfrom is stored into an instance variable. this result is then used when accessing or iterating over elements. this decision was taken to allow iterators to perform work when the iterator is created and ensure a faster iteration.

layout phase in a frame
layouting of elements is a phase executed by a space during every frame.

every frame, the space goes through several phases method blspaceframe #initializephases . phases are modeled as subclasses of class blspaceframephase and are executed once per frame. one of them, class blspaceframelayoutphase , consists in layouting the elements contained in the space. this is done after events and tasks have been executed, but before the drawing phase.

layouting should to be executed during a frame when various properties like, width, height or position change in any element contained by the space. however, an important aspect in bloc, is that when one of these properties changes, layouting is not performed immediately. instead, a layout request is issued by the element whose property changed using the message method blelement #requestlayout . this has the advantage that if no element request layout, this phase can be skipped. also it does not matter if layout is requeste one or 1000 time only one layout phase is performed improving performance.

hence, in bloc layout is not executed immediately after a property like the width of an element changes. instead layout is requested and perfomed, if needed, during every frame. when needing to test layouts, however, it is necessary to apply a layout immediately, instead of waiting for a frame to end. that can be done using the messafe method blelement #forcelayout this should not be used outside of tests, as it bypasses the normal layouting system from bloc.

in a space where all elements have no event handlers for layout events, elements are going to be layouted exactly once during the layouting phase. however, often elements need to reach and perform actions, when for example their position or extent changes. they can react by requesting another layout. a tipical example is deadling with edges. an edge can be layouted only after the position of the elements that it connects is known. hence, often the layout needs to be applied twice, or more, during the layouting phase. the space only allows layout requests during the layouting phase a limited number of times method blspace #computelayout to avoid blocking rendering due to infinite recursions caused by layout requests, or void spending too much time on layouts in a frame. more technical details can be found in the method method blspace #dolayout , the main entry point for executing the layout phase in a space.

performing a layout
the space starts the layouting process on the root element of that space. performing the layout on an element consists in executing three main steps
measuring bounds determine the bounds of the element according to its layout
applying the layout determine the position of children within the element
commiting changes raise layout events like position or extent changed.

todo why three separate steps?

measuring bounds
this is the first step when performing a layout on an element and consists in determening the measured bounds of that element.

each element can decide how it wants to be measured method blelement #onmeasure . by default class blelement delegates the measuring to its layout. layouts should override method bllayout #measure with to implement the actual measuring. normally layouts follow a top to bottom approach they measure the current element and then asks its children to do the measuring.

each element has real bounds blelement #bounds and measured bounds blelement #measuredbounds . the real bounds contain the actual position and extent of an element that users of that element should rely on. the measured bounds are used during layouting to hold the new extent of an element. the measuring phase changes only the extent in the measured bounds. after the entire layout phase is completed the real bounds and measured bounds will have the same value. the measured bounds act like a temporary cache for the new bounds of an element. they were introduced to avoid changing the real extent of element while layouting of children is still being performed.

todo explain why position is sometime changed in the measured bounds

this step find the size of an element and sets measuredextent or position sometimes
space starts the layout step
as we know the size of each child we compute the actual position for each child
changes the real extent to measured extent and the real position to the computed layout position
elements announce events for position and extent changed

without event handlers the layout process is going to happen only once.

each element has real bounds blelement #bounds and measured bounds blelement #measuredbounds . the real bounds contain the actual position and extent of an element that users of that element should rely on. the measured bounds are used during layouting to hold the new extent of an element. the measuring phase changes only the extent in the measured bounds. after the entire layout phase is completed the real bounds and measured bounds will have the same value. the measured bounds act like a temporary cache for the new bounds of an element. they were introduced to avoid changing the real extent of element while layouting of children is still being performed.

todo explain why position is sometime changed in the measured bounds

applying the layout

commiting changes

todo
space starts the measurement process from the root element after measurement it tell children to measure themselves, etc
measurement top to bottom though all the composition of elements.
this step find the size of an element and sets measuredextent or position sometimes
space starts the layout step
as we know the size of each child we compute the actual position for each child
changes the real extent to measured extent and the real position to the computed layout position
elements announce events for position and extent changed

without event handlers the layout process is going to happen only once.
for example when nodes change the position edges should be updated.

layout events

1,BlRectangleShapeWithArrowExplanation,"rectangle geometry with arrow pointer

the goal of this tutorial is to create an element with an arrow like pointer in the middle of the top edge, as shown below
example blrectangleshapewitharrowexplanation #elementwithtoparrowgeometry nocode previewshow gtlivefor previewheight 250

a traditional way to implement such geometry is to create a subclass of class blgeometry , override method blgeometry #buildpathonspartacanvas and implement quite cumbersome algorithm that computes the location of each point and then connects those points using moveto and lineto commands provided by pathbuilder . the problem with such solution is its exponential increase in compolexity each time we would like to parametrize and customize the resulting geometry, for example the size of the arrow or its horizontal position. even more compex would be to implement the support for positioning the arrow on different edges eg left, bottom or an ability to have multiple arrows on separate edges.

this is where a class blvectorshape comes in handy.

creating a rectangle shape

we will start with creation of the rectangle shape class blrectangleshape
example blrectangleshapewitharrowexplanation #rectangleshape previewshow #gtlivefor previewexpanded true previewheight 250

translating the top edge

in order to give the arrow pointing up enough space we should move the top edge of the rectangle down by the length of the arrow. first of all we should ask the rectangle shape to give us its top edge method blrectangleshape #topedge . by default the topedge of the rectangle is an instance of class bllineshape which can be translated by sending method bllineshape #moveby to the topedge
example blrectangleshapewitharrowexplanation #rectanglewithtranslatedtopedge previewshow #gtlivefor previewexpanded true previewheight 250

injecting a line inside of the top edge

next step on our way to the arrow is to inject a line segment equal to the length of the arrow in the middle of the topedge . it can be done by sending method bllineshape #injectlineat length to the topedge . since we want to inject a line right in the middle of the edge we pass 05 as a line location
example blrectangleshapewitharrowexplanation #rectanglewithtopinjectedline previewshow #gtlivefor previewexpanded true previewheight 250

splitting the injected line

we are almost ready to create a rectangular arrow. we just need to split an injected line in half in order to create the top corner of the rectangle. we can do so by sending a method bllineshape #splitat to the now middle section of the topedge which was created by the previous line injection step
example blrectangleshapewitharrowexplanation #rectanglewithtoppolylinesplitinhalf previewshow #gtlivefor previewexpanded true previewheight 250

moving the top of the triangle

once we have everything we need for the arrow triangle we can move it s top up by the length of the arrow. to do so we should send method blpointshape #moveby to the connection point of the splitted line in the middle of the topedge . after doing so we receive the expected vector shape we we can later use together with class blshapegeometry

class bltextelement provides different text measurement strategies, each suitable for a specific use case. there is no perfect strategy, therefore understanding the differences between them is an important step in learning how to work with text in bloc.

label measurement

the default text measurement strategy is so called label measurement , method bltextelement #labelmeasurement . the height of the text element in this case is a sum of ascent and descent which is given by the font. it means that the height of the text is independent from the content. the width is given by the exact bounds of the element s text. label measurement is useful for displaying labels and short pieces of text. please note, that since the width is precise and depends on the content, whitespace is not taken into account when computing the width of the text element.
example bltextelementmeasurementstrategyexamples #textelementwithlabelmeasurement nocode previewshow #gtlivefor previewheight 100

editor measurement

a similar measurement strategy which is designed to be used in a text editor computes the width of the element using the #advance property of a text paragraph. the height is computed as a sum of ascent and descent. method bltextelement #editormeasurement
example bltextelementmeasurementstrategyexamples #textelementwitheditormeasurement nocode previewshow #gtlivefor previewheight 100

precise measurement

however, sometimes we want to know the exact and precise text bounds. method bltextelement #tightmeasurement does exactly that and clips off any white space surrounding the text. it may be useful for displaying a short piece of a text, usually a word centered within a larger element.

1,GtGradAbstractTreeLayout,"this an implementation of a moen s tree layout algorithm.
moen s algorithm attempts to create a tree with a triangular shape and place nodes somewhat simetrically. it is an extension of the well known reingold tilfold algorithm. it improved the older algorithm s ability to handle non uniform sized nodes. moen s trees are oriented horizontally. however, this implementation offers the posibility of choosing the orientation vertical or horizontal.

the reingold tilfold algorithm, and thus moen s also, starts with a bottom up traversal of the tree. it calculates left and right subtrees of a tree and merges them. when doing that, it makes sure that the parents are centered above their children. reignold tilfold s algorithm was originally designed only for binary trees, but later extended to work for non binary ones as well. while reignold tilfold s algorithm produces a compact tree layout, moen s strives to make a tighter one. to accomplish that, it uses shapes represented by polyline structures. these shapes are initially formed for each leaf, so that the polyline goes around the node, but leaves the left side open. during the first phase of the algorithm s execution bottom up traversal , these shapes are merged shapes of parents are merged with shapes of children. in this implementation, we call the polylines contours. when merging contours, minimum horizontal vertical offsets at which siblings can be placed with resepct to their upper left sibling depending of the layout s orientation are calculated

once the bottom up traversal is finished, calculation of offsets is finished as well. at that point, the tree is traversed again, but this time from top root to the bottom. during this second traversal, positions of the tree s nodes are set. calculation of positions factors in the mentioned offsets, as well as the positions of the node s parent and the layout s node and level distance properties.

additionally, this implementation supports alignment of nodes top, center, bottom in case of the vertical layout and left, center, right in case of the horizontal layout . this is done through calculation of differences in sizes of nodes compared to the largest nodes on the same level, as well as the differences in sizes of their parents compared to the largest nodes on the parent level.

gtgradtreelayout is a superclass of gtgradhorizontaltreelayout and gtgradverticaltreelayout classes and contains generic tree layout methods and definitions of methods the two subclasses need to redefine. generally, the differences between the implementations of the hozitonal and vertical variants are really small, revolving around one using or setting the x and the other y coordinates.

the algorithm is implemented as described in the paper by mark bruls, kees huizing, and jarke j. van wij, squarified treemaps pdf https www.win.tue.nl vanwijk stm.pdf .

algorithm explanation

this is an adapted extract from the paper squarified treemaps mentioned above. suppose we have a rectangle with width example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodes label #width and height example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodes label #height , and furthermore suppose that this rectangle must be subdivided in seven rectangles with areas example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodes label #nodevalues . the area will be subdivided as follows
example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodes nocode codeexpanded false previewexpanded true previewshow #gtpreviewfor

the first step of our algorithm is to split the initial rectangle. we choose for a horizontal subdivision, because the original rectangle is wider than high. we next fill the left half. first we add a single rectangle. the aspect ratio of this first rectangle is example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodesfirststep label #worstvaluerounded .

example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodesfirststep previewexpanded true nocode

next we add a second rectangle, above the first. the worst aspect ratio improves to example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodessecondstep label #worstvaluerounded .
example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodessecondstep previewexpanded true nocode

however, if we add the next area 4 above these original rectangles, the aspect ratio of this rectangle is example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodesthirdstep label #worstvaluerounded .
example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodesthirdstep previewexpanded true nocode

therefore, we decide that we have reached an optimum for the left half in step two, and start processing the right half. the initial subdivision we choose here is vertical, because the rectangle is higher than wider. in step 4 we add the rectangle with area 4
example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodesfourthstep previewexpanded true nocode

in the next step, we add area 3. the worst aspect ratio decreases from example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodesfourthstep label #worstvaluerounded to example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodesfifthstep label #worstvaluerounded
example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodesfifthstep previewexpanded true nocode

addition of the next area 2 however does not improve the result as the worst aspect ratio increases from example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodesfifthstep label #worstvaluerounded to example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodessixthstep label #worstvaluerounded
example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodessixthstep previewexpanded true nocode

so we reject the previous step and start to fill the right top partition
example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodesseventhstep previewexpanded true nocode

these steps are repeated until all rectangles have been processed. the final result is the following
example gtgraphtreemaplayoutexamples #squarifywithsevennodes nocode codeexpanded false previewexpanded true .

an optimal result can not be guaranteed, and counterexamples can be set up. the order in which the rectangles are processed is important. we found that a decreasing order usually gives the best results. the initially large rectangle is then filled in first with the larger subrectangles.",,"i split an area into rectangles that are close to squares aspect ratio 1 as much as possible.

1,SpartaCanvas,"spartacanvas
i represent a sparta canvas and provide an api to perform various drawing operations.
i define an abstract api of sparta canvas that all concrete implementations must have.

overview
my main responsibility is to create and provide backend specific builders and various objects.

in order to create and perform a drawing operation users should rely on corresponding builder.
for example if one wants to fill a path with a paint she needs to send #fill message to canvas to get a fill builder painter .

there is a separate builder for every single operation. they can be found in api protocol.

i m also responsible for creation of filter primitives filter types that are used with filter operation.
they can be found in filters protocol.

i am polymorphic with spartasurface .

fill create a builder of fill drawing operation
stroke create a builder of stroke drawing operation
path create a path builder
paint create a paint builder linear, radial gradients
clip create a builder to clip canvas by path or rectangle
transform create a builder to transform canvas
font create a font build helper

i am an abstract class and should not be instantiated. however, the best way to create an instance of sparta canvas is to send extent message.

^ self privatestate attributeat #yourextendingattribute
yourentity yourextendingattribute avalue
^ self privatestate attributeat #yourextendingattribute put avalue

see mooseentitystate for more information

meta descriptions

entities should also be meta described in terms of fame. this is achieved by means of pragmas

first, on the class side, you should have a method . for example, yourentity could have
yourentity class annotation
mseclass #yourentity super #mooseentity
package yourpackage
msecomment the yourentity smalltalk class has a correspondent yourentity meta entity in the fame world

the pragma mseproperty type must be placed in the getter method to denote a fame property. for example
yourentity yourextendingattribute
mseproperty #yourextendingattribute type #yourtype
msecomment this is an attribute extended in a different package
^ self privatestate attributeat #yourextendingattribute

important api

mooseid is an integer that uniquely identifies this entity within the entire moose environment.
it should not change nor be nil. it is generated automatically during the creation of the mooseentity.
moosemodel of an entity is must be an instance of moosemodel. it may be nil if the entity is not part of a model.
each entity belongs to one and only one model, if an entity has not yet been added to a model or if an entity has been removed from a model the moosemodel is undefined, that is it may be nil.
moosedescription returns the corresponding fm3metadescription instance
moosename returns a symbol that should qualify the current entity. it does not have to be unique",mooseentity is an abstract entity.,,,"any moose entity should answer its mooseid, its moosename and its moosemodel.

the state instance variable provides a mechanism for extending the state of entities. this is achieved through mooseentitystate. using this mechanism, a package can extend an entity to add more state. this extension will only be visible when the package is loaded. this is an important mechanism to enable extensibility and modularity.

for example, if you have yourentity that subclasses mooseentity, you can extend it with

yourentity yourextendingattribute
^ self privatestate attributeat #yourextendingattribute
yourentity yourextendingattribute avalue
^ self privatestate attributeat #yourextendingattribute put avalue

this trait provides a common, paradigm agnostic vocabulary to query dependencies of software entities.

it includes some generic way to query an entity via its associations. the api offer the possibility to query an entity with three parameters
the direction of the navigation incoming outgoing in out
the kind of association famixacces, famixreference, all...
the scope of the query the receiver, the receiver and its children

the actual core of the algorithms are in moosequerycalculator class.

most of the generic methods takes a symbol to describe the direction. this symbol will be used to find a moosequeryabstactdirectionstrategy to configure a moosequerycalculator.
